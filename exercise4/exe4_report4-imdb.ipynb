The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vuzpww_vy_vm","colab_type":"code","outputId":"c7b4f368-15b0-48f6-b186-7bbfcd44e344","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1585592965878,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":12235,"user":{"displayName":"이예은","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjv6FtmxZ98tWYnesGVOOU03dzzCE2NNlIGSav3lA=s64","userId":"08006663281362763532"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17}},"source":["data_lm = TextDataBunch.from_csv(path, 'texts.csv')\n","# create text data bunch from text.csv"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":[""],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":[""],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OPWkpWqEy_vr","colab_type":"text"},"source":[" A text is composed of words, and we can't apply mathematical functions to them directly.

son relationship . xxmaj it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the premise is that the fathers in the move , hit - man xxmaj michael xxmaj sullivan ( xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks ) and his crime boss xxmaj john xxmaj rooney ( xxmaj paul xxmaj newman ) , love their sons and will do anything to protect them . xxmaj but xxmaj rooney 's son xxmaj connor is even more evil than the rest . xxmaj he kills one of xxmaj rooney 's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father . xxmaj when xxmaj connor learns that xxmaj sullivan 's son xxmaj michael witnessed it , he mistakenly kills xxmaj sullivan 's other son ( and xxmaj sullivan 's wife ) in an attempt to silence witnesses . \n"," \n","  xxmaj sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price , even at the terribly high price of perdition . xxmaj rooney , who in one scene curses the day xxmaj connor was born , refuses to give up his son xxmaj connor to xxmaj sullivan , and hires a contract killer named xxmaj maguire ( xxmaj jude xxmaj law ) to kill xxmaj sullivan and his son . xxmaj so xxmaj rooney joins his son xxmaj connor on the xxmaj road to xxmaj perdition . \n"," \n","  xxmaj for the rest of the movie , accompanied by his surviving son young xxmaj michael , xxmaj sullivan pursues xxmaj connor xxmaj rooney down the xxmaj road to xxmaj perdition , and xxmaj maguire pursues xxmaj sullivan . xxmaj when xxmaj sullivan confronts xxmaj rooney in a xxmaj church basement , and demands that he give up xxmaj connor because xxmaj connor murdered his family , xxmaj rooney says - \" xxmaj michael , there are only murderers in this room , .. , and there 's only one guarantee , none of us will see xxmaj heaven . \" xxmaj as the movie ends , somewhat predictably , one character is saved and one character repents . \n"," \n","  i 'm not a big xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks fan , but he does step out of character to play hit - man xxmaj sullivan convincingly , giving a subtle and laconic performance . xxmaj newman does well as the old xxmaj irish gangster xxmaj rooney , showing a hard edge in his face and manner , his eyes haunted by xxmaj connor 's misdeeds . xxmaj jude xxmaj law plays xxmaj maguire in a suitably creepy way . xxmaj tyler xxmaj hoechlin plays xxmaj young xxmaj michael naturally and without affectation . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness , echoing the themes of salvation and perdition . xxmaj the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys . xxmaj the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of xxmaj depression era xxmaj illinois . xxmaj the greens belonged to the younger sons and that xxmaj state 's rural xxunk . xxmaj thomas xxmaj newman 's lush , sonorous and haunting music had faint xxmaj irish overtones and was played out in xxmaj copland - like arrangements . xxmaj the sets were authentic mid - xxmaj western urban - factories , churches . xxmaj the homes shone with gleaming woodwork . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes , distinctive acting , and enveloping music and cinematography . xxmaj the only negative was a slight anti - gun message slipped into the screenplay y , the movie 's only nod to political correctness . \n"," \n","  i give this movie xxunk out of 10 ; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film .,xxbos xxmaj this noir may not be the best remembered film from the era , but it features a great mystery plot , the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members . xxmaj robert xxmaj siodmak , the talented director behind the mystery / horror classic ' xxmaj the xxmaj spiral xxmaj staircase ' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film , and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer . xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady focuses on xxmaj scott xxmaj henderson ; a man married to a woman he does n't like . xxmaj he picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night , and the two agree to a ' no strings attached ' night of fun . xxmaj however , he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! xxmaj he 's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her , and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife . xxmaj however , luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case ... \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot moves along nicely throughout , and unlike many of the better known noirs , this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting . xxmaj in fact , if it was n't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white , i would swear xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady was an xxmaj italian xxmaj giallo ! xxmaj the central characters are all interesting enough , with xxmaj alan xxmaj curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim , and xxmaj ella xxmaj raines being effective as the female impromptu detective . xxmaj the real standout of the film , however , is xxmaj franchot xxmaj tone , who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece . xxmaj the film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire xxmaj elisha xxmaj cook xxmaj jr , who features playing the drums in the film 's most memorable segment . xxmaj if i was to criticise this film , i would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . xxmaj the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady is surely one of the greatest and most under - seen noirs ever made !,xxbos xxmaj ah , true memories . i lived in xxmaj holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every xxmaj sunday evening and later xxmaj xxunk . i saw it during my 14 - xxunk . xxmaj very good for my ( at the time xxunk , as xxmaj dutch xxup tv provides subtitles for other languages , except for kiddies shows nowadays . xxmaj so you would hear the original voices and language . - xxmaj the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series , the great character , xxmaj nazi xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk , who was such a formidable enemy , disappeared from the series ( i do n't think they ever really caught him , he always escaped , leaving room to have him appear again in a next story ) because evidently the series also was distributed to xxmaj germany , and a xxmaj nazi enemy would n't go over very well ! xxmaj too bad , because xxmaj geoffrey xxmaj xxunk did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent xxmaj nazi aristocrat , who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on xxmaj england . xxmaj it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series , but xxmaj ronald xxmaj leigh - xxmaj hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal . xxmaj they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters , who at the time were about four years older than me . xxmaj it was a very exciting series to me , standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with \" the xxmaj prisoner \" as well . i hope they will publish a good quality xxup dvd of the series , that would be wonderful . xxmaj even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch . xxmaj the later series were not as good , watered down and just not as much fun as the first three . xxmaj hopefully they also find the other series with xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk to be put on xxup dvd . xxmaj greetings from xxmaj canada .,xxbos xxmaj one of several musicals about sailors on leave , it is the usual sailor meets girl , complications ensue , sorted out happily kind of plot . xxmaj it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too . xxmaj the dialogue is not as zippy as ' xxmaj top xxmaj hat ' for example and xxmaj randolph xxmaj scott seems out of place . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there are compensations . xxmaj it has some of xxmaj irving xxmaj berlin 's xxunk songs including ' xxmaj let xxmaj yourself xxmaj go ' , ' i 'm xxmaj putting all xxmaj my xxmaj eggs in xxmaj one xxmaj basket ' and ' xxmaj let 's xxmaj face the xxmaj music and xxmaj dance ' . xxmaj it has xxmaj fred and xxmaj ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they do n't disappoint here . xxmaj they do a snappy tap dance , a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance , all in the same film ! xxmaj great versatility and artistry . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it also has xxmaj harriet xxmaj hilliard who is rather good in her role . xxmaj she had a varied career , becoming the more famous xxmaj harriet xxmaj nelson with xxmaj ozzie . xxmaj here she is touching without being sentimental . xxmaj her two songs are simply and effectively delivered . xxmaj she makes a good contrast with xxmaj ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film . \n"," \n","  xxmaj more tightening up have made the film even better . xxmaj pretty good though .,xxbos xxmaj alex xxmaj winter and xxmaj keanu xxmaj reeves return as the two dopes from xxmaj san xxmaj xxunk who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the only difference is that their trip is \" somewhere \" between xxmaj heaven and xxmaj hell and ends up being both . xxmaj when they meet the xxmaj grim xxmaj reaper , they get the chance of an after -

son relationship . xxmaj it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the premise is that the fathers in the move , hit - man xxmaj michael xxmaj sullivan ( xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks ) and his crime boss xxmaj john xxmaj rooney ( xxmaj paul xxmaj newman ) , love their sons and will do anything to protect them . xxmaj but xxmaj rooney 's son xxmaj connor is even more evil than the rest . xxmaj he kills one of xxmaj rooney 's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father . xxmaj when xxmaj connor learns that xxmaj sullivan 's son xxmaj michael witnessed it , he mistakenly kills xxmaj sullivan 's other son ( and xxmaj sullivan 's wife ) in an attempt to silence witnesses . \n"," \n","  xxmaj sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price , even at the terribly high price of perdition . xxmaj rooney , who in one scene curses the day xxmaj connor was born , refuses to give up his son xxmaj connor to xxmaj sullivan , and hires a contract killer named xxmaj maguire ( xxmaj jude xxmaj law ) to kill xxmaj sullivan and his son . xxmaj so xxmaj rooney joins his son xxmaj connor on the xxmaj road to xxmaj perdition . \n"," \n","  xxmaj for the rest of the movie , accompanied by his surviving son young xxmaj michael , xxmaj sullivan pursues xxmaj connor xxmaj rooney down the xxmaj road to xxmaj perdition , and xxmaj maguire pursues xxmaj sullivan . xxmaj when xxmaj sullivan confronts xxmaj rooney in a xxmaj church basement , and demands that he give up xxmaj connor because xxmaj connor murdered his family , xxmaj rooney says - \" xxmaj michael , there are only murderers in this room , .. , and there 's only one guarantee , none of us will see xxmaj heaven . \" xxmaj as the movie ends , somewhat predictably , one character is saved and one character repents . \n"," \n","  i 'm not a big xxmaj tom xxmaj hanks fan , but he does step out of character to play hit - man xxmaj sullivan convincingly , giving a subtle and laconic performance . xxmaj newman does well as the old xxmaj irish gangster xxmaj rooney , showing a hard edge in his face and manner , his eyes haunted by xxmaj connor 's misdeeds . xxmaj jude xxmaj law plays xxmaj maguire in a suitably creepy way . xxmaj tyler xxmaj hoechlin plays xxmaj young xxmaj michael naturally and without affectation . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness , echoing the themes of salvation and perdition . xxmaj the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys . xxmaj the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of xxmaj depression era xxmaj illinois . xxmaj the greens belonged to the younger sons and that xxmaj state 's rural xxunk . xxmaj thomas xxmaj newman 's lush , sonorous and haunting music had faint xxmaj irish overtones and was played out in xxmaj copland -

although xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . xxmaj the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , xxmaj phantom xxmaj lady is surely one of the greatest and most under - seen noirs ever made !,xxbos xxmaj ah , true memories . i lived in xxmaj holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every xxmaj sunday evening and later xxmaj xxunk . i saw it during my 14 - xxunk . xxmaj very good for my ( at the time xxunk , as xxmaj dutch xxup tv provides subtitles for other languages , except for kiddies shows nowadays . xxmaj so you would hear the original voices and language . - xxmaj the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series , the great character , xxmaj nazi xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk , who was such a formidable enemy , disappeared from the series ( i do n't think they ever really caught him , he always escaped , leaving room to have him appear again in a next story ) because evidently the series also was distributed to xxmaj germany , and a xxmaj nazi enemy would n't go over very well ! xxmaj too bad , because xxmaj geoffrey xxmaj xxunk did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent xxmaj nazi aristocrat , who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on xxmaj england . xxmaj it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series , but xxmaj ronald xxmaj leigh - xxmaj hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal . xxmaj they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters , who at the time were about four years older than me . xxmaj it was a very exciting series to me , standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with \" the xxmaj prisoner \" as well . i hope they will publish a good quality xxup dvd of the series , that would be wonderful . xxmaj even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch . xxmaj the later series were not as good , watered down and just not as much fun as the first three . xxmaj hopefully they also find the other series with xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk to be put on xxup dvd . xxmaj greetings from xxmaj canada .,xxbos xxmaj one of several musicals about sailors on leave , it is the usual sailor meets girl , complications ensue , sorted out happily kind of plot . xxmaj it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too . xxmaj the dialogue is not as zippy as ' xxmaj top xxmaj hat ' for example and xxmaj randolph xxmaj scott seems out of place . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there are compensations . xxmaj it has some of xxmaj irving xxmaj berlin 's xxunk songs including ' xxmaj let xxmaj yourself xxmaj go ' , ' i 'm xxmaj putting all xxmaj my xxmaj eggs in xxmaj one xxmaj basket ' and ' xxmaj let 's xxmaj face the xxmaj music and xxmaj dance ' . xxmaj it has xxmaj fred and xxmaj ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they do n't disappoint here . xxmaj they do a snappy tap dance , a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance , all in the same film ! xxmaj great versatility and artistry . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it also has xxmaj harriet xxmaj hilliard who is rather good in her role . xxmaj she had a varied career , becoming the more famous xxmaj harriet xxmaj nelson with xxmaj ozzie . xxmaj here she is touching without being sentimental . xxmaj her two songs are simply and effectively delivered . xxmaj she makes a good contrast with xxmaj ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film . \n"," \n","  xxmaj more tightening up have made the film even better . xxmaj pretty good though .,xxbos xxmaj alex xxmaj winter and xxmaj keanu xxmaj reeves return as the two dopes from xxmaj san xxmaj xxunk who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the only difference is that their trip is \" somewhere \" between xxmaj heaven and xxmaj hell and ends up being both . xxmaj when they meet the xxmaj grim xxmaj reaper , they get the chance of an after -
